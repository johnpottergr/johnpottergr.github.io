          At Edify Content
        </h2>
        <p>
        At Edify Content,
        I produced around 15 long-form technical articles per month,
        typically targeting B2B, software, and data engineering audiences.
        Content followed SEO best practices such as internal linking, optimized headers,
        keyword grouping, meta descriptions to drive organic visibility.
</p>
<p>When clients didn‚Äôt have SEO direction, I employed SEMrush and related SEO tools to
identify low-competition, high-relevance keywords. This keyword strategy
helped deliver content that aligned with audience intent and search engine expectations.

          At Corporate Conversions
        </h2>

        <p>
        At Corporate Conversions, a local SEO firm, I focused on analytics-driven SEO reporting.
        Using Google Analytics, I created reports tying keyword performance to revenue over time. These reports
        uncovered trends in organic vs. paid traffic, tracked backlink quality, and compared SERP
        visibility across competitors‚Äîinsights that helped clients adjust their content strategies and budget allocations.

        I was originally brought on to build a WordPress site, but the role quickly expanded into full-site SEO ownership. Along the way, I became comfortable with assessing plugins, customizing themes, and improving site performance with tools like Cloudflare and WP Super Cache. I also used the Yoast plugin to run technical SEO audits and identify on-page improvements.</p>
        <p>
        That experience proved valuable when I was later asked to maintain product descriptions for a local industrial equipment company. Working hands-on gave me the confidence to troubleshoot most issues independently without relying on developers, which is a skill I still draw on today.

          Freelance & Self-Directed Work
        </h2>
        <p>
        As Executive Director of GRAPE, a business-related nonprofit, I produced email marketing campaigns for lunch-and-learn events and other initiatives, managing a 10,000-member subscriber list. This involved segmenting audiences and running A/B tests to improve engagement and drive attendance. I also produced daily, targeted content optimized around the keyword phrase ‚Äúbusiness networking,‚Äù which helped the nonprofit‚Äôs website steadily climb in local search rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
        Separately, I supported a friend's small business by managing outreach through HubSpot, eventually earning a certification in outbound marketing. That experience deepened my understanding of CRM-driven campaign flows and sales enablement via automation. I also became familiar with Shopify‚Äôs CMS while running an anime-themed product business, primarily handling email communication and managing storefront content.

            Preparing for the AI-Driven Future of SEO
        </h2>
        <p>
        I‚Äôm especially interested in how AI agents and large language models are
        reshaping how people find information. SEO is evolving into
        Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)‚Äîstructuring and tagging content for retrieval
        by AI systems, whether in Slack-based support agents or LLMs parsing structured web content.
        </p>
        <p>
        Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring how content platforms like Mintlify MCP can make content more dynamic, reusable, and machine-readable.
        I'm also experimenting with adapting traditional SEO tactics like schema markup, topic clusters, and structured FAQs so they serve
        both organic search and AI-driven interfaces.
