        </h2>
        <p>
        At Edify Content,
        I produced around 15 long-form technical articles per month,
        typically targeting B2B, software, and data engineering audiences.
        Content followed SEO best practices—internal linking, optimized headers,
        keyword grouping, meta descriptions—to drive organic visibility.
</p>
<p>When clients didn’t have SEO direction, I employed SEMrush and related SEO tools to
identify low-competition, high-relevance keywords. This keyword strategy
helped deliver content that aligned with audience intent and search engine expectations.

        </h2>

        <p>
        At Corporate Conversions, a local SEO firm, I focused on analytics-driven SEO reporting.
        Using Google Analytics, I created reports tying keyword performance to revenue over time. These reports
        uncovered trends in organic vs. paid traffic, tracked backlink quality, and compared SERP
        visibility across competitors—insights that helped clients adjust their content strategies and budget allocations.

        was originally brought on to build a WordPress site, but the role quickly expanded into full-site SEO ownership. Along the way, I got comfortable auditing plugins, customizing themes, and improving site performance with tools like Cloudflare and WP Super Cache. I also used the Yoast plugin to run technical SEO audits and identify on-page improvements.</p>
        <p>
        That experience proved valuable when I was later asked to maintain product descriptions for a local industrial equipment company. Working hands-on gave me the confidence to troubleshoot most issues independently without relying on developers, which is a skill I still draw on today.

          Elsewhere
        </h2>
        <p>
        As Executive Director of a business-focused nonprofit, I led email marketing for lunch-and-learn events and campaigns,
        managing a 10,000-member subscriber list. This included segmentation and A/B testing to drive attendance and engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
        Separately, I supported a friend's small business by managing outreach via HubSpot, eventually earning certification in outbound marketing.
        That experience deepened my understanding of CRM-driven campaign flows and sales enablement through automation. As an aside, I also became
        familiar with Shopify's CMS when running an anime product business.

          The Future
        </h2>
        <p>
        I’m especially interested in how AI agents and large language models are
        reshaping how people find information. SEO is evolving into
        Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)—structuring and tagging content for retrieval
        by AI systems, whether in Slack-based support agents or LLMs parsing structured web content.
        </p>
        <p> I'm currently exploring ways to adapt traditional SEO tactics—schema markup,
          topic clusters, and structured FAQs—so that content is
          usable by both search engines and emerging AI interfaces.
