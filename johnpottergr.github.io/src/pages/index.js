  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a technical writer with 7+ years of experience in fintech, blockchain, and more. I’ve published 300+ articles on AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy working with clients to create clear, engaging content—whether that’s articles, guides, or documentation—that resonates with users and supports business goals. While I've primarily written articles, I’ve also contributed to technical documentation and am eager to take on more of it.
