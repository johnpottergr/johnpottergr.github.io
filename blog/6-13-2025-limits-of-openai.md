title: The Limits of OpenAI

Constructing a custom content brief generator is an exciting endeavor. If done right, you can end up with a Clearscope-style tool that analyzes and summarizes the main topics from top-ranking search results. But testing your tool can also test your patience.

Being a writer, I’ve found ChatGPT to be genuinely useful. Sure, I’ve had to work around the usual AI tells and cliché phrasing. But it’s been a positive experience overall.

So when it came to choosing an LLM for this tool, I instinctively chose OpenAI. GPT 4 was a known quantity; it had the ecosystem and a simple API.

After some testing, however, I realized it was coming up short, especially when it came to flexibility, speed, and trial experience. That’s when I moved to Gemini 1.5.

## Why I switched: short version
OpenAI's developer API is impressive on paper. It gives you access to powerful LLM models like GPT 4 and GPT 3.5. But using these models at even small scale with their free tier left me coming up short. And I was only focused on testing.

Rate limits kicked in almost immediately. For a tool intended to analyze several URLs one after the other, having to wait or retry because of usage caps really bogged the entire process down. Even after switching from GPT 4 to GPT 3.5, I still ran into constraints.

In the end, OpenAI did provide me much leeway when it came to testing their service. But it certainly pushed me for an upgrade. Before doing so, however, I wanted to see what my alternativew were.

## A quick look at alternatives
In my search for an alternative, Anthropic's Claude was tempting, especially since it excels at tasks needing context. But its pricing was confusing and its access was limited.

Grok was fast and open, but not quite ready for production without extra work. I needed a solution that offered managed APIs rather than one that required me to babysit models.

## Gemini 1.5: Faster and Cheaper
Google's Gemini API was not an obvious first pick. It was hard to discern what product would be best for me: Studio, Pro, Flash, AI Platform. But once I'd figured out how to integrate Gemini 1.5 Flash into my application, I noticed an immediate improvement in speed.

What really clinched the deal was Google Cloud's $300 free trial. It's generous enough to allow for extensive testing. The trial is linked to a billing account, so users have to be mindful not to exceed the free tier. But once the trial is activated, the user has full access to the Gemini API and can explore its capabilities.

I have being a big fan of corporate behemoths, but Google deserves accolades here.

The Gemini 1.5 flash model, which was employed for text summarization tasks, is efficient and accrate. Their system is fine tuned to handle repetitive tasks, which is perfect for generating briefs in the style of Clearscope.

## Not entirely free, but worth the cost
It's true - neither OpenAI nor Gemini really offer a usable free tier for production. But Gemini's free trial is generous compared to its competitors and gave me a solid feel for the platform before I have to start paying.

Its paid tiers are reasonably priced, especially if you are able to use the 1.5 flash model instead of the more expensive 1.5 pro version.

## Last words
Looking back, starting with OpenAI was a good move. For a content analysis tool that must retrieve and arrange several URLs in order, Gemini 1.5 Flash came through where OpenAI couldn’t: with speed, reliability, and cost effectiveness.

I'll still use OpenAI for other purposes. In this instance, Gemeni came out head. If you’re creating something comparable and feel constrained by OpenAI’s capabilities, give Gemini a shot. Its $300 trial goes a long way.
