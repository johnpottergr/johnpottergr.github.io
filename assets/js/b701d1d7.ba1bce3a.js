Several LLMs come close, particularly Google\u2019s Gemini (it's so straightforward!). At Edify Content, the content team relied on Surfer SEO until early 2024.

More troubling was the predictability of the output and its occasional errors."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Surfer SEO also lacked versatility.

You now have the capability to set content guidelines and produce draft content by analyzing particular rival pages in the SERP.
